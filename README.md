### Learning Outcome

While I have experience in languages like Java and C from the classes I have taken, I have not been taught web development. This website will grow and will increase in functionality as I learn the skills necessary to implement certain aspects. I am currently in the process of learning JavaScript and how to incorporate Bootstrap.
